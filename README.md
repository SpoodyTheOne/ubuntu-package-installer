# ubuntu-package-installer
Simple electron app insaller for ubuntu.

# Build
run `npm run-script dist` to create a .deb
once installed packages can be installed using `appinstaller package`

# FYI
Don't use this btw, it's shitty, overcomplicated and I made it in one sitting at 1 am. Feel free to fork
